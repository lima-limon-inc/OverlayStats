prtunnel can tunnel TCP/IP connections in a variety of ways, including through
HTTP and SOCKS5 proxy servers. Some if its possible uses include:
- Tunneling TCP connections from client programs to a remote server through an
HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy (useful if you're behind such a proxy and want to use a
program that doesn't have native proxy support)
- Tunneling TCP connections from SOCKS-capable client programs through an HTTP
or SOCKS5 proxy
- Tunneling TCP connections from an IPv4 client program to an IPv6 server and
vice-versa
- Forwarding TCP connections
- Running as a simple SOCKS proxy server
