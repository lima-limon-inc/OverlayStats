Introduction
------------

Due to the Live-USB requirement of having a fallback address in case that
no DHCP server is present on the network, `net-misc/networkmanager` has
been deliberately held back on version 1.0.12 since the very first release
of the systemd edition of Bubbagen back in 2016. Latest changes to the main
tree make it impossible to maintain this version and thus the time has come
to upgrade to a newer version.

Luckily the original issue with newer versions of networkmanager has since
been resolved, but a user patch is still required for accepting the fallback
address in case that no DHCP server is present.


Action Required
---------------

To prevent your updates, whether you use genup or manual, failing
on `net-misc/networkmanager`, you will need to delete the following
files:

  /etc/portage/package.mask/networkmanager
  /etc/portage/patches/net-misc/networkmanager/dhcpcd-static-profile.patch

Should you however wish to maintain the functionality of the fallback
address, rather then deleting the patch file you should make the following
changes inside it:

  On lines 7 and 8 change `/dhcp-manager/` to `/dhcp/`
  On line 9 change both instances of `202` to `311`

The corrected patch will also be part of the next update of
`app-admin/bubbagen`
