Introduction
------------

The latest stable netifrc 0.7.1 introduces a new module named `iw` for
configuring wifi adapters in client mode. Sadly this intervenes with the
Access Point mode that is managed through the Bubba B3 GUI and the result
is that your LAN interface will not become active.


Action Required
---------------

To prevent network failure on your wifi enabled B3, you will need to add
the following line to `/etc/conf.d/net`

  modules_wlan0="!iw !iwconfig !wpa_supplicant"

A new revision of app-admin/bubba-networkmanager has been released to
control this required entry in future.
