With the upgrade to LogitechMediaServer 8.0 a less time consuming install method
has been found which makes creating a bin package obsolete. For now the older
LMS 7.8 bin package will remain inside the repository, but no further updates to
perl 5.32 and higher will be made available.

Note that to upgrade to LMS 8.0 you must first uninstall the bin package. If one
of your Squeezebox devices is a Squeezebox Radio continue reading the next news item
for vital information to continue using the Radio after upgrade to LMS 8.0
