Introduction
------------

Unfortunately the latest Squeezebox Radio firmware (7.7.3) comes with a
bug which prevents it from connecting to Logitech Media Server 8+. A patch
is available, but the Radio must still be connected to LMS 7.8 to be able
to install it.

Action Required
---------------

On the Radio go to `Settings/Advanced/Applet Installer`, install the Patch Installer.
The Radio will re-boot.

Once it's back, go to `Settings/Advanced/Patch Installer`, install the "Version Comparison Fix".



No other Squeezebox devices are affected
