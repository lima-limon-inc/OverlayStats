* Things of interest (in order of decreasing interest)
| Package                     | Rationale                                    |
|-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| =app-emacs/ebuild-tools=    | Access ebuilds quickly from Emacs            |
| =app-emacs/ement-extras=    | Use Matrix from Emacs with encryption        |
| =app-emacs/telega=          | A featureful Telegram client for Emacs       |
| =app-emacs/portage=         | Issue ~emerge~ commands from Emacs           |
| =app-emacs/magentoo=        | A Gentoo dashboard based on =magit-section=  |
| =app-emacs/pdf-tools=       | Read PDF with poppler in GUI Emacs           |
| =dev-lisp/sbcl=             | Bootstrappable with a user-specified Lisp    |
| =app-doc/ansicl=            | ANSI Common Lisp Draft: Info and PDF         |
| =app-emacs/elpa-to-ebuilds= | Generate ebuilds for Elisp packages          |
| =app-emacs/imdb=            | Emacs IMDB client with local database        |
| =app-emacs/vterm=           | USE =system-libvterm=; native =emacs-module= |

=dev-lisp/sbcl= also allows omitting html doc thus avoiding dependency on =graphviz=.

There is a variety of other =app-emacs/*= packages in the repository, some mine.  Some are not present in elpas, e.g. =app-emacs/pdf-mode=.

* Installation
** With =eselect repository=
#+begin_src sh :dir /sudo::/ :tangle no :results none
eselect repository enable akater
#+end_src

To remove the repository,
#+begin_src sh :dir /sudo::/ :tangle no :results none
eselect repository remove akater
#+end_src

** Manually
Add the following to your =repos.conf=:
#+begin_example conf-unix
[akater]
location = /var/db/repos/akater
masters = gentoo
sync-type = git
# sync-git-verify-commit-signature = true
# sync-openpgp-key-path = /var/akater.asc
sync-uri = https://gitlab.com/akater/ebuilds.git
auto-sync = yes
#+end_example

** With =layman=
#+begin_src sh :dir /sudo::/ :tangle no :results none
layman -o  https://gitlab.com/akater/ebuilds/-/raw/master/repositories.xml -f -a akater
#+end_src

To remove the repository,
#+begin_src sh :dir /sudo::/ :tangle no :results none
layman -d akater
#+end_src

* Notes
This ebuild repository may contain:
- some older ebuilds dropped from mainline gentoo repository but interesting to the author
- a variety of =app-emacs/*= ebuilds
- ebuilds providing compatibility with environments interesting to the author
- experimental stuff (but most ebuilds should work)

I'm interested in lightweight environments, i.e.:
- text-only environments (no X)
- non-glibc environments (musl, at this point); there are some uClibc related ebuilds but uClibc profile is deprecated in Gentoo right now

Some ebuilds do not work, including:
- =app-emacs/libegit2=
- =sys-firmware/open-ath9k-htc-firmware=

I'd appreciate help with them.

To understand the purpose of forks of ebuilds from the main tree, I recommend simply diffing ebuilds.  For convenient ebuild (multi-)diffs, consider my function ~diff-ebuilds~ provided by =app-emacs/ebuild-tools=.

I'm interested in
- =www-client/palemoon= support for hardened Gentoo
- =net-print/lprng= ebuilds and filters
- automated packaging of Emacs Lisp software for Gentoo
