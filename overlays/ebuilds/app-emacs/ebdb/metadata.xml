  EBDB is a contact management package: it records information about
people and organizations, and integrates with other Emacs software
packages, mostly those concerned with sending and reading mail.  The
principle parts of EBDB are records, which represent people and
organizations; fields, representing detailed data about records; and
databases, which hold and persist records.

  EBDB is like BBDB but EIEIO-based.
