  PDF Tools is, among other things, a replacement of DocView for PDF files.
The key difference is that pages are not pre-rendered by e.g. ghostscript
and stored in the file-system, but rather created on-demand and stored in
memory.  This rendering is performed by a special library poppler, running inside a server program called epdfinfo.  Displaying PDF files is just one part of PDF Tools.  Since poppler can provide us with all kinds of information about a document and is also able to modify it, there is a lot more we can do with it.
