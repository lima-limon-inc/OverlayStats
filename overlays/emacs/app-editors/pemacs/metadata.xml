  Perfect Emacs is a small footprint Emacs derived from Chris Baird's
  Ersatz Emacs which was based on MicroEMACS 3.6 as released to
  mod.sources and the Public Domain by Daniel Lawrence in 1986, and
  was itself based on the work of Steve Wilhite and George Jones to
  MicroEMACS 2.0 (then also public domain) by Dave Conroy.

  Perfect Emacs is an attempt to find the perfect balance between
  minimalism (i.e. the smallest functional emacs and code) whilst
  still retaining the feeling of GNU Emacs.
