INTRO

	In 1999, Fox published a one-a-day calendar of Homer Simpson
quotes.  On the back of each page was the name of the episode from the
quote came, providing us fanatics with some fun trivia.  At some
point, I decided that it'd be nice to have all of those quotes in a
file parsable by `fortune`.  So, you get what we have here.
