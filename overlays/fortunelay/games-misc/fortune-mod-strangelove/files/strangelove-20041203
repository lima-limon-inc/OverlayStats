    Rooskies.

    But today, war is too important to be left to politicians. They have
    neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic
    thought. I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration,
    Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international
    Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily
    fluids.

    Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I
    do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending
    on the breaks.

    General Jack D. Ripper: Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of

    Ah, oh, no, I don't think they wanted me to talk really, I don't
    think they wanted me to say anything. It was just their way of

    bloody good cameras.

    On no account will a Commie ever drink water, and not without good

    I think you're some kind of deviated prevert. I think General Ripper

    Do I look all rancid and clotted? You look at me, Jack. Eh? Look,
    eh? And I drink a lot of water, you know. I'm what you might call a
    water man, Jack - that's what I am. And I can swear to you, my boy,
    swear to you, that there's nothing wrong with my bodily fluids. Not
    a thing, Jackie.

    General Jack D. Ripper: You know when fluoridation first began?

    Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake: I... no, no. I don't, Jack.

    General Jack D. Ripper: Nineteen hundred and forty-six. Nineteen
                            forty-six, Mandrake. How does that coincide
                            with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh?
                            It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign
                            substance is introduced into our precious
                            bodily fluids without the knowledge of the
                            individual. Certainly without any choice.
                            That's the way your hard-core Commie works.
