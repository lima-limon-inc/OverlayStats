		<flag name="ghc-bundled-libffi">When GHC is configured without @--with-system-libffi@, it
will bundle its own copies of @libffi@, one of them
statically linked and the other dynamically linked. This
flag will force linking against the static copy of @libffi@
that GHC bundles. This avoids a GHC bug
(https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15397) that
can arise when the linker confuses the system&#39;s dynamic
@libffi@ with GHC&#39;s own dynamic @libffi@.
Note that this flag only works when GHC is configured
without the @--with-system-libffi@ option. This is the case
for most GHC binary distributions, such as those provided
by @ghcup@. If you are using a GHC that was configured with
@--with-system-libffi@, however, you will need to disable
this option and link against the system&#39;s version of
@libffi@ instead.</flag>
