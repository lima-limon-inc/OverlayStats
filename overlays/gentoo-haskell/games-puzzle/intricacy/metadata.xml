	<longdescription>
		A lockpicking-themed turn-based puzzle game on a hex grid. A series of
		preset puzzles serves as an extended single-player introduction, after
		which players enter a multi-player game with a client-server architecture,
		in which players design puzzles (locks) and solve those designed by
		others. A metagame encourages the design of maximally difficult puzzles,
		within tight size constraints. The client supports Curses and SDL, with
		all graphics in SDL mode drawn by code using SDL-gfx. The network protocol
		is based on the 'binary' package, and is intended to be reasonably
		efficient. TVars are used to give transparent local caching and background
		network operations. Also incorporates an implementation of a graph
		5-colouring algorithm (see GraphColouring.hs).
