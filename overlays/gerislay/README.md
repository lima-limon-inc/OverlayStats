# Gerislay

Personal overlay of Gerion.

## Masking
Feel free to use any of the ebuilds, but don't expect stable ones. 

I recommend to add:
```
*/*::gerislay
```
to your package.mask.

## Installation
Use layman
```
layman -a gerislay
```
or with [eselect-repository](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-eselect/eselect-repository):
```
eselect repository enable gerislay
```

Improvements and Pull Requests are welcome. Please open an issue for this.
You can also send me patches per mail.
