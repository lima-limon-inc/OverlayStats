		This library handles only the crypto part of OMEMO, not the XMPP protocol part. This means you need to take care yourself of things like publishing/downloading bundles, publishing/subscribing to PEP deviceliste updates, sending and receiving messages.
		Initial codebase was forked from https://github.com/tgalal/python-axolotl but has since been heavily rewritten.
