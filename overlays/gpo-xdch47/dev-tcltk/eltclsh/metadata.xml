<longdescription>eltclsh (editline tcl shell) is an interactive shell for the TCL programming language. It provides command line editing, history browsing as well as variables and command completion thanks to editline features. The completion engine is programmable in a way similar to tcsh, and comes with an intelligent completion for the full tcl language by default.

The package also provides elwish, an interactive interpreter for the Tk toolkit.</longdescription>
