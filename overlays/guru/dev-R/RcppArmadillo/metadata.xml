	<longdescription lang="en">'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad
Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of
use. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported, as
well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various
matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with
LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.	The 'RcppArmadillo' package includes the
header files from the templated 'Armadillo' library. Thus users do
not need to install 'Armadillo' itself in order to use
'RcppArmadillo'. From release 7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is licensed
under Apache License 2; previous releases were under licensed as MPL
2.0 from version 3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3 prior to that;
'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed
under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'.
Armadillo requires a C++11 compiler.</longdescription>
