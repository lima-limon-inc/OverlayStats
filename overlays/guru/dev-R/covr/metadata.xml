	<longdescription lang="en">Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally)
upload the results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' &lt;https://codecov.io&gt; or
'Coveralls' &lt;https://coveralls.io&gt;. Code coverage is a measure of the amount of
code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect measure of test
quality and completeness. This package is compatible with any testing
methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled
C/C++/FORTRAN code.</longdescription>
