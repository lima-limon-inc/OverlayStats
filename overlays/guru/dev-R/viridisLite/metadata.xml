	<longdescription lang="en">Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with
common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color
maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when
converted to black-and-white for printing. This is the 'lite' version of the
'viridis' package that also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and
continuous color and fill scales and can be found at
&lt;https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis&gt;.</longdescription>
