  <longdescription lang="en">This module lets one associate a set of files with a process name. Currently, the name is implied to be the rank within MPI_COMM_WORLD. In the event that a set of distributed processes are moved, for example when restarting an MPI job, functions will migrate files from their original locations to the new locations where the processes are running.
