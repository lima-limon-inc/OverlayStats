fontFeatures library
The purpose of this library is to provide a middle ground for representing features in a machine-manipulable format, kind of like the abstract syntax tree of a computer programmer. This is so that:

    features can be represented in a structured human-readable and machine-readable way, analogous to the XML files of the Unified Font Object format.
    features can be more directly authored by programs (such as font editors), rather than them having to output AFDKO feature file format.
    features can be easily manipulated by programs - for example, features from two files merged together, or lookups moved between languages.

Components

fontFeatures consists of the following components:

    fontFeatures itself, which is an abstract representation of the different layout operations inside a font.
    fontFeatures.feaLib (included as a mixin) which translates between Adobe feature syntax and fontFeatures representation.
    fontFeatures.ttLib, which translates between OpenType binary fonts and fontFeatures representation. (Currently only OTF -> fontFeatures is partially implemented; there is no fontFeatures -> OTF compiler yet.)
    fontFeatures.fontDameLib which translate FontDame text files into fontFeatures objects.

And the following utilities:

    otf2fea: translates an OTF file into Adobe features syntax.
    txt2fea: translates a FontDame txt file into Adobe features syntax.
