Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API. This uses the Google Translate Ajax API to make calls to such methods as detect and translate.

Compatible with Python 2.7+ and 3.4+. (Note: Python 2 support will be dropped in the next major release.)

For details refer to the API Documentation.
Features

    Fast and reliable - it uses the same servers that translate.google.com uses
    Auto language detection
    Bulk translations
    Customizable service URL
    Connection pooling (the advantage of using requests.Session)
    HTTP/2 support

TODO

more features are coming soon.

    Proxy support
    Internal session management (for better bulk translations)

HTTP/2 support

This is a great deal for everyone! (up to 2x times faster in my test) If you want to get googletrans faster you should install hyper package. Googletrans will automatically detect if hyper is installed and if so, it will be used for http networking.
How does this library work

You may wonder why this library works properly, whereas other approaches such like goslate wonâ€™t work since Google has updated its translation service recently with a ticket mechanism to prevent a lot of crawler programs.

I eventually figure out a way to generate a ticket by reverse engineering on the obfuscated and minified code used by Google to generate such token, and implemented on the top of Python. However, this could be blocked at any time.
