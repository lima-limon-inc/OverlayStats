bit is an experimental modernized git CLI built on top of git that provides happy defaults and other niceties:

command and flag suggestions to help you navigate the plethora of options git provides you
autocompletion for files and branch names when using bit add or bit checkout
automatic fetch and branch fast-forwarding reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts
suggestions work with git aliases
new commands like bit sync that vastly simplify your workflow
commands from git-extras such as bit release and bit info
fully compatible with git allowing you to fallback to git if need be.
get insight into how bit works using bit --debug.
