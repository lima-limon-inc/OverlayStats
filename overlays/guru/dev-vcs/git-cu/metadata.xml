    git-cu helps keep your local git repositories organized by cloning
    them into a directory structure based on their URL.

    For example, running a regular `git clone` of this repository with
    `git clone https://gitlab.com/3point2/git-cu.git` will create a
    `git-cu` directory inside your current working directory.

    Using `git cu` instead of `git clone` will create a
    `gitlab.com/3point2/git-cu` directory structure inside your
    current working directory.

    cu is short for "clone URL", pronounced "see you".
