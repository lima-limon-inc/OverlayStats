+.SH NAME
+clasp \- a conflict-driven nogood learning answer set solver 
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B clasp
+[\fInumber\fR] \fR[\fIoptions\fR]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B clasp
+command.
+.PP
+.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
+.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
+.\" respectively.
+\fBclasp\fP is an answer set solver for (extended) normal logic
+programs. It combines the high-level modeling capacities of answer set
+programming (ASP) with state-of-the-art techniques from the area of
+Boolean constraint solving. The primary clasp algorithm relies on
+conflict-driven nogood learning, a technique that proved very
+successful for satisfiability checking (SAT). Unlike other learning
+ASP solvers, clasp does not rely on legacy software, such as a SAT
+solver or any other existing ASP solver. Rather, clasp has been
+genuinely developed for answer set solving based on conflict-driven
+nogood learning. clasp can be applied as an ASP solver (on LPARSE
+output format), as a SAT solver (on simplified DIMACS/CNF format), or
+as a PB solver (on OPB format).
+.SH OPTIONS
+These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
+options starting with two dashes (`-').
+A summary of options is included below.
