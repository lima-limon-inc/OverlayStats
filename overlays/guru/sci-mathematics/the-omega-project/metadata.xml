This is the Omega Project software, including:
* The Omega library, a set of routines for manipulating linear constraints over integer variables, Presburger formulas, and Integer tuple relations and sets.
* The code generation library, a set of routines for generating code to scan the points in the union of a number of convex sets.
* The Omega calculator, a text-based interface to the Omega library
* Petit, a educational/research tool for analyzing array data dependences
* The Uniform library, a source to source parallelizing transformation system, described in Wayne Kelly's Ph.D. dissertation.
Many new features have been added, and numerous bugs fixed, by a number of groups since the August 2000 version 1.2 
from the cs.umd.edu web site. A quick check of the omega calculator regression tests 
indicates that there is one difference in the generated code for a time-skewed example, 
but this may just be an equivalent iteration space expressed in a different way.
