Introduction
Recent generations of the Intel® Xeon® family processors allow configurations where:

Turbo Boost can be enabled on a per-core basis.
Some cores can be given a higher base frequency than others
Overview
The scripts provided are as follows:

power.py allows the user to adjust the frequencies and Turbo-Boost availability on a core-by-core basis. This script allows the adjustment of P-states, C-states and Turbo-Boost.
sst_bf.py allows the user to confure the system for Intel® Speed Select Technology - Base Frequency (Intel® SST-BF). This allows some cores to run at a higher base frequency than others.
pwr.py a python library which can be imported into an application, to measure/modify core frequencies of a CPU to utilize Intel® Speed Select Technology.

The 'pwr' library is built to help take advantage of various Intel processor features such as:
- Core and uncore frequency scaling
- SST-BF technology
- SST-CP technology
It is intended to be used to build various orchestration and platform power management tools.
