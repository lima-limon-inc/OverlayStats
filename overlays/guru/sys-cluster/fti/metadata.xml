FTI stands for Fault Tolerance Interface and is a library that aims to give computational scientists the means to perform fast and efficient multilevel checkpointing in large scale supercomputers. FTI leverages local storage plus data replication and erasure codes to provide several levels of reliability and performance. FTI is application-level checkpointing and allows users to select which datasets needs to be protected, in order to improve efficiency and avoid wasting space, time and energy. In addition, it offers a direct data interface so that users do not need to deal with files and/or directory names. All metadata is managed by FTI in a transparent fashion for the user. If desired, users can dedicate one process per node to overlap fault tolerance workload and scientific computation, so that post-checkpoint tasks are executed asynchronously.
