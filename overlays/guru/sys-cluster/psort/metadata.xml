	<longdescription lang="en">PSORT is a parallel sorting code for distributed and shared memory architectures. It uses MPI for communication, and is designed to minimize the volume of communication. It has been tested on terabyte datasets with up to 256 processors. It does not use sampling to locate splitters, and hence no prior knowledge of the probability distribution is required. It provides several options for splitting, sequential sorting and merging. A parallel sample sort is also included.
