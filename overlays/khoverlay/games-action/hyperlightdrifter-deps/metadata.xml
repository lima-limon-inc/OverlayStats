    Hyper Light Drifter is a cryptic and surreal adventure game by Heart
    Machine.

    This ebuild does not contain the game.  It can be obtained from elsewhere,
    for example from Humble Bundle.  This ebuild pulls in the 32-bit
    dependencies necessary to play the game, since its Linux release, at least
    from Humble Bundle, ships without libraries.
