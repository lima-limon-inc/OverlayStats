  <longdescription>
    Daemon and system setup tool for hardware compatibility with
    System76 computers.  System76 hardware requires various tweaks to
    system configuration depending on the specific machine model.  This
    package provides a tool for performing initial configuration, with
    both a GUI and CLI interface.  Other tweaks are applied by a daemon
    that is launched on system boot.  Confusingly, both the daemon's
    service and the setup tool's executable name are both called
    system76-driver.

    Upstream only supports systemd, but this ebuild includes an
    experimental OpenRC init script too.

    This ebuild also functions as a metapackage, pulling in other
    packages that are needed for System76 hardware, such as kernel
    modules.
