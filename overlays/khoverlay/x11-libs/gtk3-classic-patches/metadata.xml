  <longdescription>
    gtk3-classic is a set of patches that revert many of the look-and-feel
    changes made during GTK 3's development, restoring it to a more classic
    desktop experience a la GTK 2.

    This package only installs patches into /etc/portage/patches.  It is up to
    the administrator to ensure that x11-libs/gtk+:3 is rebuilt after installing
    the corresponding version of this package.  If both packages are included in
    one emerge run, this package encourages Portage to build x11-libs/gtk+:3
    after, using PDEPEND.

    If desired, the 'gtk' USE flag on this package can be disabled to
    skip pulling in x11-libs/gtk+:3, for example to update to the latest
    gtk+:3 before gtk3-classic-patches is updated.

    Some select changes, see the homepage for the full list:

    - Client-side decorations are disabled by default on X11.
    - Typeahead is restored in the file chooser, no recursive search.
    - Dialog buttons are again right-aligned.
    - Backdrop CSS state (inactive window shading) is disabled by default.
    - File dialog context popup menu has the traditional look.
    - Scrollbars are visible by default.
