This module is intended to provide a general-purpose date and datetime type for perl. You have a Class::Date class for absolute date and datetime, and have a Class::Date::Rel class for relative dates.

Note that this module is fairly ancient and dusty. You might want to take a look at DateTime and its related modules for a more standard, and maintained, Perl date manipulation solution.
