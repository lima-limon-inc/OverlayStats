PGChange is a Sqitch-like framework for managing changes in a PostgreSQL
database.  Unlike Sqitch, it is PostgreSQL-specific, but it also supports
multiple stable upgrade paths.  It was purpose build for the LedgerSMB
project but could be used by other projects which manage multiple stable
release branches.
