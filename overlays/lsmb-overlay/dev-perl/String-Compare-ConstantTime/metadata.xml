       This module provides one function, "equals" (not exported by default).

       You should pass this function two strings of the same length. Just like perl's "eq", it
       will return true if they are string-wise identical and false otherwise. However, comparing
       any two differing strings of the same length will take a fixed amount of time. If the
       lengths of the strings are different, "equals" will return false right away.

       NOTE: This does byte-wise comparison of the underlying string storage, meaning that
       comparing strings with non-ASCII data with different states of the internal UTF-8 flag is
       not reliable.  You should always encode your data to bytes before comparing.
