<longdescription lang="en">
Perl 5.8.0 misses subtraction and intersection of characters, which is described in Unicode Regular Expressions (UTS #18). This module provides a mimic syntax of character classes including subtraction and intersection, taking advantage of look-ahead assertions.

The syntax provided by this module is considerably incompatible with the standard Perl's regex syntax.

Any whitespace character (that matches /\s/) is allowed between any tokens. Square brackets ('[' and ']') are used for grouping. A literal whitespace and square brackets must be backslashed (escaped with a backslash, '\'). You cannot put literal ']' at the start of a group.
