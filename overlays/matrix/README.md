Welcome to an overlay of packages related to the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) chat!

Reporting bugs
====

The quality of this overlay is "works for me". Unfortunately, I do not have
the skills/resources to test everything properly, though I am working on being
better at it. If something is not working for you, please, let me know! You
can leave a bug report or a feature request at
[GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/anton.molyboha.group/gentoo/overlays/matrix/-/issues)
or
[Gentoo Bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org/)
(If using Bugzilla, make sure to CC: anton.stay.connected@gmail.com)


New packages
====

I'll be happy to add most matrix-related packages if you help test that they
"work for you". Many bridges and maubot plugins are not in the repository just
because I'm not using them and thus cannot test the package! If you do want me
to add a package to the repository and are ready to test it, leave a feature
request via any of the bug trackers mentioned above.
