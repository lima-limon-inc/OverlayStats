# VATSIM switched to a JSON-based data format in April 2021. Old QuteScoop
# versions based on code before May 2021 are no longer able to natively
# receive and display VATSIM data. Version 2.3 is the first release
# supporting the new format.
# Older versions are only useful if you want to display data from other
# networks which still provide information in the legacy CSV-like "Whazzup"
# format.
