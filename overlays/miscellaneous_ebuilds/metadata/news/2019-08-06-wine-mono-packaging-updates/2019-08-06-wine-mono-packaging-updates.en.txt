Following the change to split the Wine Mono package, back in April 2019,
this is now finally implmented in the ::bobwya Wine Overlay packages. This
affects all recent Wine packages:

 * >=app-emulation/wine-staging-4.6
 * >=app-emulation/wine-vanilla-4.6 

and Wine Mono packages:

 * >=app-emulation/wine-mono-4.8.1

See the wine-devel mailing list thread, announcing this change:
https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2019-April/143379.html

As this change is being applied retrospecitvely - you may find you
have issuing updating existing WINEPREFIX's. Any WINEPREFIX's
which have the standard MSI binary wine-mono package installed.
These need to be updated to the new Wine Mono split (binary)
packages. The new Wine Mono packages have a central
shared component, stored in:

    "/usr/share/wine/mono/${P}/"

(where P = wine-mono-<version>)

and a much smaller component which is installed to each WINEPREFIX.
Overall, with multiple WINEPREFIX's, this should result in a small
storage space saving.

If a number of WINEPREFIX's are affected, then it is probably worth
scripting this update. Something like:

    wineboot -u &
    sleep 10s
    wineserver -k
    wineboot -u

will probably work. The first wineboot call should successfully
uninstall the older MSI Wine Mono package. However it may
get confused and try to download the newer Wine Mono split package.
Hence killing the first update and restarting it... So the
operating should succeed - without any end user intervention!
