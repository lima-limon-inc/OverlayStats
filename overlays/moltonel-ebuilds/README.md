# Gentoo ebuilds repository

Holds some [Gentoo](http://gentoo.org/) ebuilds that I haven't (yet) bothered/managed to upstream.

To install, `git clone` somewhere and add that directory to PORTAGE_OVERLAY in `/etc/portage/make.conf`.

Please use the github issue tracker for any enquiries or requests.

Repository itself is public domain, some ebuilds and especially dependent files might have a different license.
