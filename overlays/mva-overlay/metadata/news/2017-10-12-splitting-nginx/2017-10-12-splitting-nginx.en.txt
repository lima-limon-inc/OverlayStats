Hi there!
I've splitted all the third-party modules out of the NginX ebuild.
Since now (>=1.13.6) that modules will be maintained separately.
Also, it should be easier to contribute new ones.

Although, you should keep few things in mind:

1) Since now, you *MUST* load all the modules you use.
    As easy option, you can add following command as the first
    line in your nginx.conf file:

        include modules.d/*.conf;

    If you prefer to manually specify only the modules that you're
    really use in your configuration, you can use:

        load modules/[module_name].so;

    directive for that.

2) Some modules (the ones that pathces NginX source to call functions
    from inside themselves, and so *requires* static linking, even
    despite I made them to be a dynamic module) are currently broken.
    (For example, it is 'www-nginx/upstream-check').

    Also, some of such modules can miss some functionality (like the
    support of NginX's internal round-robin upstream) because of the
    same problem.

    Actually, they shouldn't patch nginx sources in the first place.

    But due to their abandonment (having last commits about 4-10 years
    ago), there is nobody to fix that problems.

    I'll try to fix that in the future, but I can't promise anything.

    Anyway, if you have any problems - feel free to post the issue on
    GitHub or write me an email.
