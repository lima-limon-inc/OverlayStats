	<longdescription lang="en">Pynvim implements support for python plugins in Nvim. It also works as a library for connecting to and scripting Nvim processes through its msgpack-rpc API.

	Compared to the Gentoo repo this ebuild has RDEPEND in addition to DEPEND. I am testing its interaction with binpkgs before submitting a pull request.
