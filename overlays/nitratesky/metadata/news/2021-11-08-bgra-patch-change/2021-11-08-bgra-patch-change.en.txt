x11-libs/libXft-2.3.4 has been stabilized in the main repo.

The x11-libs/libXft-bgra-patch package will be split into two:

* One for 2.3.3 libXft version
* One for 2.3.4 libXft version

The versions of the patch package will match the libXft version
and have corresponding dependencies.

The previous 9999 version corresponds to the 2.3.3 version and
will be kept up while libXft-2.3.3 remains in the main tree.

The 2.3.4 version separates the original merge request into three
separate patches to pin the commit ids and (should something change)
allow for easier troubleshooting of changes.
