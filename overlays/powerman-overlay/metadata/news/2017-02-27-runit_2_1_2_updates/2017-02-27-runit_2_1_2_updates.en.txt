All installed services was moved from /service/ to /etc/sv/.
All running services was moved from /var/service/ to /etc/service/.

To complete this move you should manually update paths used by symlinks
in /etc/service/ from /service/ to /etc/sv/:

    for s in /etc/runit/runsvdir/*/*; do
    	ln -snf "$(readlink "$s" | sed 's:^/service:/etc/sv:;s:/$::')" "$s"
    done

After reboot you can remove /var/service.
