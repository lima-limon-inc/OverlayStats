# ToDo

Below are notes I have planned/may consider to do as well with their status. Things that have been checked will be added to the overlay public when it is tested for potetial problems on my end. Once public they will  be removed from this file.


### High

- None


### Medium

- [ ] Update gentoo wiki Budgie section with instructions and introductions.
- [ ] Take a look at the logo's inside budgie-control-center and see if I need to add a gentoo mark on it. To make it consistant with other similar applications (gnome-control-center e.g.)


### Low

- [ ] Think about adding in the test useflag for budgie-control-center to mirror gnome-control-center and see if things are needed or wanted.


### Unlikely

- [ ] Make a separate document for further tweaks of budgie-desktop if wanted. (e.g. not showing nm-applet tray icon if using the network applet from budgie-extras)
- [ ] Look into specific budgie themes maybe.
