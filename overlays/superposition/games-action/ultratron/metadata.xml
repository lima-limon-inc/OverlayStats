Enter the world of Ultratron and experience the addictive gameplay of old-school arcade favourites such as Robotron: 2084, updated and improved for the 21st century!

Unique retro-futuristic sound and graphics, player responsive difficulty, and a subtle system of tactics combined with classic gameplay make Ultratron a fun and hypnotic arcade blast.

The last human has been slain by evil killer robots. You are the one remaining humanoid battle droid. Your mission: avenge the human race!

Blast your way through 40+ glowing neon levels, avoiding Chasers, Turrets, Spawners, Minelayers, bombs, and bullets, and take on the four giant boss 'bots of the Apocalypse - Ieiunitas, Bellum, Lues and Letum!
Classic old-school arcade arena action!

Boost your battledroid with ever more powerful weaponry, destroy Spiderbots to gain extra special weapon abilities and field defence and pet drones to help you along.
