Scratch is a new programming language that makes it easy to create your
own interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art -- and share
your creations on the web.

Scratch is designed to help young people (ages 8 and up) develop 21st
century learning skills. As they create Scratch projects, young people
learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while also gaining
a deeper understanding of the process of design.
