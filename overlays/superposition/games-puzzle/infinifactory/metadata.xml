Infinifactory is a sandbox puzzle game by Zachtronics, the creators of SpaceChem and Infiniminer. Build factories that assemble products for your alien overlords, and try not to die in the process.

    LIKE SPACECHEM… IN 3D! - Design and run factories in a first-person, fully 3D environment.
    HISTOGRAMS ARE BACK! - Optimize your solutions, and then optimize them more when you see how much better your friends did.
    VISIT EXOTIC ALIEN LOCALES! - Explore a story-driven campaign with 50+ puzzles, audio logs, and more.
    BLOCKS THAT MOVE! - Go beyond the campaign and push the limits of Infinifactory’s next-generation block engine in the sandbox.
