The old xfce4-wmdock-plugin, which depended on GTK+2, has been dropped due to
all GTK+2 dependencies being removed from Xfce 4.16. xfce4-wmdock-plugin-gtk3 is
moved to xfce4-wmdock-plugin:3.

To solve this, deselect xfce4-wmdock-plugin-gtk3 and install
xfce4-wmdock-plugin:

emerge --deselect xfce4-wmdock-plugin-gtk3
emerge xfce4-wmdock-plugin
