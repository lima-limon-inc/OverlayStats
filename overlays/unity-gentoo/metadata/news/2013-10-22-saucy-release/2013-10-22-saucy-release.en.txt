!!Saucy Release!!

As of the Saucy release, Unity uses Gnome 3.8 and so this requires you enable systemd. 
While systemd is not strictly needed for Gnome 3.8 to build, it is needed at runtime. 

From http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GNOME/3.8-upgrade-guide ... 
  "GNOME 3.8 requires systemd to be running to get it working properly, otherwise,
  you will get broken power management and multiseat handling, and also some more
  problems because upstream has moved away from the obsolete consolekit to logind
  (that needs systemd to be running to work)."

It is highly recommended you get the system working with systemd before proceeding with the Unity desktop installation
  (see http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Systemd)
