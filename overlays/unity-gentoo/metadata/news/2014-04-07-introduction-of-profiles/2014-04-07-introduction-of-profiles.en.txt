The process of having to manually symlink masks and keywords files into /etc/portage/package.*/ is being deprecated.

For the upcoming release (Trusty Tahr), a 'unity-gentoo' overlay profile must now be selected.

The unity-gentoo profiles available for your architecture can be found with the 'eselect profile list' command.

Using ubuntu-versionator.eclass, the overlay will automatically check the selected profile is valid and provide checks
that the unity-build-env:0/<PROFILE> package is pre-installed ready for the Unity desktop (unity-meta) to be installed.

This should simplify the upgrade/downgrade process for users who previously had to manually make symlinks:
1. 'eselect profile list' and set to unity-gentoo profile for your arch
2. 'emerge unity-build-env:0/<PROFILE>'
3. 'emerge -uDNavt unity-meta'

For convenience the old unity-portage.p* files still exist so as not to break pre-existing symlink installations.

However it is strongly recommended to migrate over to the new profile setup as the unity-portage.p* files will be removed once Trusty is stable in overlay.
