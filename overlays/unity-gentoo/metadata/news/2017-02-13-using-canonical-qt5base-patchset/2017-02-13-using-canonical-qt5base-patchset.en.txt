As of Yakkety (16.10) release, Unity8 is now being shipped by Canonical
as a preview status software with the view to it being a
fully useable desktop by Zesty (17.04) release.

Unity8 uses a combination of QT5's EGL and QML functionality
to render the desktop atop the new Mir EGL display server.

This means that for building/execution sanity and correct functionality
of the new Unity8 desktop, it is important to align with the same
QT5 software versions and implemented bugfixes that Canonical perform.

For this reason unity-gentoo overlay now uses QT5 ebuilds of the same version
expected by Unity8, and implements their QT5 base patchset for same.

To bring your system to use the new QT5 ebuilds ready for Unity8,
it is highly recommended you perform the following in order:

emerge -1avt $(qlist -ICS dev-qt/ | grep \:5)
revdep-rebuild --library 'libQt5Core.so' -- -avt
