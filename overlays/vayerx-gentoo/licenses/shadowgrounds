SOURCE CODE README AND FURTHER LICENSE NOTES
-------------------------------------------------
Last update to this file: 6th of June 2011 (v1)

This source code package allows you to compile the games develop them further if you wish (for non-commercial purposes). All other files, including the art assets and the level editor, remain the sole property and copyright of Frozenbyte. You may not distribute any of the files not included in the source code package. Should the source code include any 3rd party files or software, the copyright remains with the original owner and you are not allowed to distribute or modify such files or software. It is also forbidden to distribute Shadowgrounds or Shadowgrounds Survivor, or any direct derivative, in any way (e.g. not even for free), in any "app stores" such as the Mac App Store or similar, or in any distribution channel that has authorization control by a third party. 

If you have a question about the license or a specific file, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're mostly just covering our legal base with this stuff. 

Please note that we cannot provide any official support for this source code release. You can however visit the Frozenbyte Community at http://www.frozenbyte.com/board/ to discuss the games and the source. 



NOTES
-------------

The source code as it is packaged may not compile properly. This package includes both the Windows and Linux/Mac source code. However, it might be better to use the separately packaged SG/SGS source code archive for Windows purposes, because it differs slightly from this. At the very least run a diff comparison tool and see for yourself. 

Shadowgrounds specific code is under /shadowgrounds, and Shadowgrounds Survivor under /survivor . 

Shadowgrounds does not use PhysX, but Shadowgrounds Survivor does.

PhysX SDK can be obtained from NVIDIA - see http://developer.nvidia.com/physx/ or
http://supportcenteronline.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=1949

More PhysX help: http://physxinfo.com/news/901/how-to-register-developer-account-to-get-physx-sdk-access/
and http://knol.google.com/k/introduction-to-the-nvidia-physx-api

To get the game assets, you need a copy of each game. 



SPECIAL NOTES
-------------

The Shadowgrounds games are quite old and possibly very messy - these sources have not been cleaned too much.

There may also be references to older projects, such as "Disposable" or "DH", which mean our very first game, an (RTS) prototype from 2001-2003. (It should be possible to enable several RTS commands such as unit groups, switching sides to aliens and so on.)

It's also worth noting that the source code has a lot of "hacks" and "todos". It is in many ways messy and could be hard to understand. 

We haven't had a commercial name for the game engine, but internally it's been called "Storm3D". Storm3D is partially based on work by the awesome Finnish programmer Sebastian Aaltonen, from whom we bought the original code in 2000/2001. 

Good luck! :)
