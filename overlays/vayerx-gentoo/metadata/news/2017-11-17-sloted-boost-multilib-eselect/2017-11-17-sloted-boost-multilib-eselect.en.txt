Slotted boost now supports multilib build. However this change is incompatilbe with previous versions.
All installed versions of slotted boost should be re-emerged before new eselect will be able to operate.

You may encounter the following message:
 * Installation of a directory is blocked by a file:
 *   '/usr/share/boost-eselect/profiles/X.YY/default'
 * This file will be renamed to a different name:
 *   '/usr/share/boost-eselect/profiles/X.YY/default.backup.0000'

It is OK. You will need to remove backuped file manually.
