# violet-funk

Gentoo ebuild overlay based around FNF, with miscellaneous useful software as a bonus.

The mods in this overlay are *currently* binaries; the base game, however, is a source ebuild. The mods are currently being migrated to source ebuilds, so do expect some rockiness during the process.

This repository can be enabled using either:

`sudo eselect repository enable violet-funk` (if you are using `app-eselect/eselect-repository`)

`sudo layman -a violet-funk` (if you are using `app-portage/layman`)

I accept (almost) any suggestions as to which mods to port and/or include in this overlay. You may open an issue with the mod to suggest ***granted it has accessible source code.*** Please include the link to the mod's source code when suggesting a mod.
